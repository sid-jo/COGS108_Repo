# COVID-19 and Commerce

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has left a significant impact on global economies, with consumer behavior and industry trends reflecting its effects. This project investigates pre- and post-pandemic consumer trends across 18 major industries in the United States over a 10-year period. By analyzing datasets on American commerce and pandemic infection rates, we aim to quantify the pandemic's economic impact and identify key trends.

## Key Contributions
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using standard Python data science libraries. Key trends and relationships across industries were identified and discussed in detail.

**Predictive Modeling:** Implemented multiple linear regression models to further assess the pandemic's impact on specific industries of interest, selected from EDA. 

**Video Presentation:** Delivered a concise 5-minute presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodologies, and conclusions.

## Tools and Technologies
**Programming Languages:** Python

**Data Analysis Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Objectives
1. Analyze historic data on American commerce trends leading up the pandemic
2. Model the pandemic's impact on major industries
4. Present methodologies and findings through written report and a brief video presentation

## Conclusion
This project provides a preliminary analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on several industries throughout the U.S., combining in-depth data analysis with regression modeling. By focusing the relationship between pandemic metrics and consumer trends, we uncover insights into the resilience and vulnerabilities of different industries. The findings are presented in a digestible video presentation and offer further avenues of analysis to generate a holistic picture of the economic impact of COVID-19.
