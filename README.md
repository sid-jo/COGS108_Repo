# COVID-19 and Commerce

## Overview
It is well-known that a nation's economy can accurately reflect its well-being, so examining the behavior of several industries during the time leading up to and into the pandemic may generate key indicators with which the pandemic's impact can be quantified. This project investigates pre- and post-COVID-19 American consumer trends across 18 major industries over a 10-year period. Utilizing various datasets on American consumer trends and pandemic infection rates, we aim to provide insights into how annual patterns within and across industries were impacted during the pandemic.

## Key Contributions
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** This was conducted using standard data science libraries in Python. Multiple datasets were cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to extract and preliminary relationships in the data. Plots and discussion of these trends are provided in the notebook.

**Predictive Modeling:** Implemented multiple linear regression models to further assess the pandemic's impact on specific industries of interest, selected from EDA. 

**Video Presentation:** A short 5-minute presentation of the project components, methodologies, and conclusions.

## Tools and Technologies
**Programming Languages:** Python

**Data Analysis Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Objectives
1. To analyze historic data on American commerce trends leading up the pandemic
2. To model the pandemic's impact on major industries
4. To present methodologies and findings through brief video presentation

## Conclusion
This project provides a preliminary analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on several industries throughout the U.S. By combining in-depth data analysis with regression modeling, we are able to better visualize and interpret the relationship between pandemic infection/death rates and consumer trends. We present the findings in a digestible video presentation and offer further avenues of analysis to generate a holistic picture of the economic impact of COVID-19.
